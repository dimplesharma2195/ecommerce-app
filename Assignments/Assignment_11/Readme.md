# Storing and Deleting the New Movies into the Database

### Problem:

Currently, the movie that you are adding doesnâ€™t get stored anywhere.

We want to be able to save the list in the database so that we can retrieve the list whenever we want.

### Deliverables

- Watch videos 9, 10, and 11 from the following link to understand how to make the POST request.
- Can you add a delete Movie button which takes the ID of the selected movie and deletes the movie from the database?
- Update the UI so that the user gets to see that the movie has been deleted.
