    title: 'Colors',
    price: 100,
    imageUrl: 'https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/img/Album%201.png',
  },
  {
    title: 'Black and white Colors',
    price: 50,
    imageUrl: 'https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/img/Album%202.png',
  },
  {
    title: 'Yellow and Black Colors',
