# Making Add to Cart Work

## Right now you have been able to design a cart component which uses hardcoded `cartElements`.

## Deliverables

We want to be able to make the Add to Cart button work, somehow.
The cart icon should show the number of items in the cart, just like this app - [Cart Example](https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/dynamicstore.html)

---

## Steps - Pretty Simple

1. We would be using the Context API to solve this.
2. Imagine if you can read the `cartElements` from the Context API instead of using hardcoded `cartElements`.
3. When the user adds to Cart, add the element in the store or increase the quantity if the element already exists.
4. The cart icon should show the number of items in the cart.
