# Adding New Movies into the List

### Problem Statement

Currently, there is no way to add new movies from the frontend.

### Deliverable

- Can you create a form on top of the fetch movie button to Add Movies? It should look like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GehkpuXd8BhcP_fmK-D7G_VCIV6Y8NOS/view?usp=sharing
- When the user clicks on the Add Movies button, show all that he has input in the form in the browser by doing console.log(NewMovieObj).
- Always keep optimization in your mind.
