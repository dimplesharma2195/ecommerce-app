# Making API Calls in React

## Watch video 1 and 2 from the following link and answer the following:

- Why should we not connect to a database from the frontend itself? What is the problem?
- What is the ideal way to connect to databases?

---

## Watch video 3 and 4 from the above link and answer the following:

- What is the default method type of fetch API -> GET or POST?
- When I do `fetch('https://swapi.dve/api/films')`, what is the default method type here?
- What is JSON? Why do we do `response.json()`?
- What does `fetch()` return? Why do we need to use `.then`?
- Why can't we simply write `const response = fetch(url)`?
- Code along with the Udemy trainer.

---

## Deliverable

Since `fetch()` returns a promise, can you write the entire code using `async` and `await`? Too many `.then` blocks look very bad. It is very simpleâ€”try it by yourself.

[If stuck for very long, please check video 5 from the above link.]
