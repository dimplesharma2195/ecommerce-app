# Fetch Movie on Page Load

One problem with the current website is that when you click on the button Fetch Movies, only then does it get the data.

Watch this playlist to understand useEffect better: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4dunL3FOEk2RkMLDvWanol5zxvMNqe7F. Watch all the 4 videos.

## Deliverable [Try it by yourself]

- When the user comes to your page, make an API call and get the data so that the user can see all the movies without clicking on the Fetch Movies button. [Hint: you have to use the useEffect hook]
- Optimize the code by using memoization and useCallback wherever possible.

If stuck for long, watch video 8 from the following link. But try first by yourself.

Push the code to Git and upload the commit ID.
