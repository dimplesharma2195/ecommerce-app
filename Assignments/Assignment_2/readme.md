# Cart Component

## Deliverable

Make a cart Component with hard coded products. [Currently you don't have to build the Add to Cart functionality - We would do that in the next task]

Take a hardcoded array like this and show all the elements in the cart:

```javascript
const cartElements = [
  {
    title: 'Colors',
    price: 100,
    imageUrl: 'https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/img/Album%201.png',
    quantity: 2,
  },
  {
    title: 'Black and white Colors',
    price: 50,
    imageUrl: 'https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/img/Album%202.png',
    quantity: 3,
  },
  {
    title: 'Yellow and Black Colors',
    price: 70,
    imageUrl: 'https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/img/Album%203.png',
    quantity: 1,
  }
];
```

1. When the user clicks on the cart icon at the top right, open the cart and show all the cart items saved in the hardcoded `cartElements` array.
2. Add a remove button next to the cart elements so that the user can remove the elements from the cart.

The cart should work like this: [Cart Example](https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/dynamicstore.html)

### Things pending to integrate [Will do in the next tasks, don't have to do in this task]
- Add to cart next to the product should work. [Will use Context API here]
- About and home page need to be built.

## Solution:
In the uploaded `src` folder.
