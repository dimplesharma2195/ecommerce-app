# Implement the About Page in the Most Optimized Way

## Deliverables

The About page should be built in such a manner that when the user clicks on the About button at the top, the user should be redirected to the About Us page, and the route should change as well.

The routes should change so that you can share the URL with your friends, and they can see it as well: [About Page Example](https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/about.html)

## Steps to Implement

1. **Understanding Routing in React**
   - Watch video 1 and 2 from the Udemy course link to understand routing better.
   - We use a concept called routing to implement such pages in React.
   - Watch videos 3, 4, and 5 from the Udemy course and answer the following:
     - What is the problem with using `<a href></a>` (anchor tags)?
     - How does `Link` solve the issue of anchor tags?
     - Why do we use `NavLink`? Why is it better than `Link`?

2. **Implement the About Page**
   - Use `NavLink` so that when the user clicks on it, they are redirected to the About Us page just like in the example: [About Page Example](https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/about.html)
