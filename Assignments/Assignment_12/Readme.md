# Adding Contact US Page via REACT ROUTER

### Problem:

The Ecommerce site which you had built lacked a Contact Us page.

Customers that face any issues should be able to report that to you.


### Useful Resources:

React Router is the most widely used package in React.js.

No project is built without it.

To understand what problem it solves, watch videos 1 to 6 from the following link and implement the following.


### WARNING!!!!:

We are going to use the old React Router v5 version.

V6 version is fairly new and not a lot of companies have migrated.


## Deliverable

- Add a separate Navigator on the top, next to the About button.
- When the user clicks on it, take him to the Contact Us page.
- In the Contact Us page, show the User a form which takes the following inputs -> Name, Email ID, Phone Number of the user.
- When the user clicks on submit, store the data into Firebase DB by doing a POST request.


Push the code to git and upload the commit ID.
